Summarize your understanding of `node_modules` and it's relationship with `package.json` (covered in the video for the lesson).

        When bun downloaded, it also downloaded the node modules. In the gitignore file under it, it tell the terminal to ignore the node dependencies and instead lets us run bun to install things as we go instead of carrying all the installations at once.

What does the ${} syntax do inside backticks? Why is it useful?

        When a variable name is inside the brackets, whatever that variable represents replaced the ${var} during the output.

What happened when you saved your code in VS Code? (Did it auto-format? Did you see any errors?)

        It auto formatted and I didn't see any errors. It also auto saved when I clicked off the file with the help of te onFocusChange in the settings.

How many commits did you make for this assignment? Why is it better to make multiple small commits instead of one large commit?

        In total I will make 3 commits including this one once im finished answering my reflection questions. It's better to make multiple small commits so that you are able to reverse and make other changes if needed before pushing into public eye.

When do we use `const` vs `let`? What about `var`?

        `const` is used as default in variable creation and it never changes through the code. `let` is used when the the code/project demands the variable to change within use or reason. `var` is an out dated version of `let` that isn't used anymore in the dev community.
